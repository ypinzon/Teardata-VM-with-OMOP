Teradata-VM-with-OMOP Vantage Advanced SQL Engine (NOS Enabled, Python, R, Vantage Analytics and STO)
Teradata Vantage Modules for Jupyter provide extensions to the JupyterLab platform to enhance the user experience connecting and executing SQL statements on Teradata Vantage. These extensions include the Teradata SQL Kernel, Navigator, and Connection Manager.

In addition, we have bundled the Teradata driver for Python and teradataml library as well as the Teradata driver for R and tdplyr library. The teradataml and tdplyr libraries contain functions that interact with Vantage in the Python and R languages respectively.  
Connection support to add, remove, connect, and list connections
    Query engine that uses embedded Teradata SQL driver
    SQL aware notebook with SQL content assist and syntax checking
    Result set renderer that displays result data in easy to read, pageable grid
    Execution history that stores execution metadata to recall SQL commands at a later time
    Visualization using Vega library to display charts, graphs, plots, etc.
    Support for basic data load from a file
    Magic commands that provide additional custom kernel options to enhance Teradata user experience
   
   The Navigator Provides
   The ability to explore the Advanced SQL Engine catalog, regardless of the language you are using in your notebook (SQL, Python, R).
   Hierarchical display of SQL object relational model
   Column metadata showing data type and indexes
   Row Count, Show DDL, Refresh and Column Distribution menu options
    
    The Connection Manager:
    Connection management to add, remove, edit, copy, list, and test connections,
    User interface that is independent of the SQL notebook
    Connections are shared with the Navigator and SQL notebooks

    Refer to the GettingStartedDemo notebook (/notebooks/sql directory) for a live example running Teradata SQL kernel magics. Also included are notebooks demostrating loading       data (DataLoad) and using the new charting features (ChartingDemo)
